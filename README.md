# Expl

Expl stands for EXPression Language, it was ELPL before,
But it is too obscure to be called "English Like
Programming Language"


## Compiling from source
You will need gcc/clang to compile the C file,
Try: gcc excc.c -o excc
If you get some weird error you can always create 
a new issue.

### How to expl
Ok, you now have two files, main.exc and the 
Interpreter, your code must have a main.exc file,
Why? Because i'm lazy, delete the example main.exc
And create another one, now, on it, type:

    >a
    N

Save the file as main.exc and run excc.

> a

But there is the sad part, you can only print
__one__ character a time.
